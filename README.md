# First-React-App-TS

This is my first react app

it has simple code to link the nickname and profile picture with the one on this account using github api

it's designed to track inputs and save them and what time it was submitted

i also used some typescript

npm i
npm run dev
http://localhost:5173/

it outputs errors on the console if you add two of them at the same second because the IdKey is the time submitted
